/**
 * In this package, we provide a graphic which does not perform any actual
 * rendering. Instead, it implements the
 * {@link org.optimizationBenchmarking.utils.text.textOutput.ITextOutput}
 * interface. This is somewhat of a hack to allow specialized chart drivers
 * to print their contents to a text file instead of actually producing a
 * graphic.
